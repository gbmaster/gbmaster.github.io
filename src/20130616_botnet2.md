In the previous post, the routing table has been analysed; in this one, the first type of messages exchanged to get into the Kad network will be discussed. I found out that there are some PDFs here and there describing the old Kad flow, so I will discuss here just the new one. I already said that a contact in the normal nodes.dat is automatically included into the routing table, but what if there is just a bootstrap nodes.dat available? That's what the KADEMLIA2\_BOOTSTRAP\_REQ message does: it's sent to one of these contacts to retrieve a list of contacts to be added to the routing table.

**KADEMLIA2\_BOOTSTRAP\_REQ (opcode 0x01)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2\_BOOTSTRAP\_REQ opcode

Pretty straightforward packet, huh? This packet is sent (in obfuscated form or not, as usual) to one of the contacts of the bootstrap list and, when received, the remote contact retrieves all the contacts in the routing table tree that are stored in K-buckets not deeper than the 5th level. The first 20 contacts in the list (or less, if not available) are sent in the response message, as follows.

**KADEMLIA2\_BOOTSTRAP\_RES (opcode 0x09)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2\_BOOTSTRAP\_RES opcode
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: local contact ID
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: local TCP port
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad version used
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: number of contacts included
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: contact's contact ID
- **unsigned int 32-bit**: contact's IP address
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: contact's UDP port
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: contact's TCP port
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: contact's version
- ...

The last 6 fields are repeated for each contact. Once this packet is received, if the bootstrap list is empty, the sender is added to the routing table as a verified contact. All the other contacts are added directly to the routing table (if the routing table is empty, all these new contacts will be considered as verified to speed up the connection process).

At the end of the process, the routing table is not empty anymore and a KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_REQ can be sent to the contacts.

**KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_REQ (opcode 0x11)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2_HELLO_REQ opcode
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: local contact ID
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: local TCP port
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad version used
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: number of tags used
- ...

Apart from the usual information here included, we meet a new element: _tags_. What is a tag? It is a piece of information identified by a nama, with its own length and type. When a tag is dumped over a buffer, it has the following structure:

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: tag type
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: tag name length
- **string of variable length**: the tag name (its length is specified in the previous field)
- **unsigned char []**: buffer of data (can be integers, strings, blobs, etc)

For some of them, parsing data is simple. For integers we need to just cast the buffer and we'll directly get the value. For strings the first two bytes of the buffer store the length of the string that follows immediately.

Only two tags can be included in this message: the Kad internal UDP port and some connection options.

- If the external UDP port is unknown (the one seen on the other side of the potential NAT between my PC and the Internet), then the internal UDP port must be included in this message as a 16-bit integer (tag name TAG\_SOURCEUPORT).
- If the remote Kad version is at least 8 and the client is still firewalled (TCP or UDP port not forwarded on the NAT), then the information about the firewall status must be included in this message as an 8-bit integer (tag name TAG\_KADMISCOPTIONS): the first bit is 1 if we are UDP firewalled, the second bit is 1 if  we are TCP firewalled and the third bit will be analysed later (not used in the KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_REQ).

When this packet is received, the information is added (or updated) to the routing table (if and only if the contact is not UDP firewalled or the filtered by some IP filter).

At the end, a KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_RES packet is sent, containing the same information of this message, but, if the contact has been added AND it didn't already sent a valid receiver key (or maybe it changed), TAG\_KADMISCOPTIONS's third bit is set to 1: an additional ACK message is requested to complete a three-way-handshake and verify the remote IP. Unfortunately, this new message is not supported on client version 7: the handshake is completed by sending a KADEMLIA2\_PING message.

KADEMLIA2\_PING is sent anyway, in case we are still looking for the UDP external port and the remote contact version is at least 5.

If a firewall check is still needed, a KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED2\_REQ message is sent (see later).

**KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_RES (opcode 0x18)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2_HELLO_RES opcode
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: local contact ID
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: local TCP port
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad version used
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: number of tags used
- ...

This message is indentical to KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_REQ, as it carries the same information in the same layout. When it is received, the contact is added (or updated) to the routing table with the same criteria seen for its twin message. If the client requested to send an ACK message to end the handshake, a KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_RES\_ACK is sent to that client.

Again, if the UDP external port is yet to be found and the remote contact is at least 5, a KADEMLIA2\_PING message is sent. If the firewall check is still needed, the KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED2\_REQ message is sent as well.

**KADEMLIA2\_HELLO\_RES\_ACK (opcode 0x22)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2_HELLO_RES_ACK opcode
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: local contact ID
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: number of tags used (set to 0)

When received, the contact is set as verified in the routing table and the three-way-handshake is declared as over.

**KADEMLIA2\_PING (opcode 0x60)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2\_PING opcode

The only purpose of this message, for now, is to determine the own UDP external port. Once received, the KADEMLIA2\_PONG will contain only this information.

**KADEMLIA2\_PONG (opcode 0x61)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA2\_PING opcode
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: UDP port

After receiving this message, if we are still looking for the external UDP port, the potential UDP port is added to the UDP port candidates list. The port included in the message doesn't necessarily coincide to the real external port because, if the internal port has been used recently in a communication with the client, some routers may remember this port and set it as source.

_The search for the external UDP port is stopped when the same port is received after 2 out 3 tries._

**KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED2\_REQ (opcode 0x53)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED2\_REQ opcode
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: TCP port
- **unsigned int 128-bit**: local contact ID
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: connect options

This message requests the receiver to connect to the specified TCP port, on which a local TCP server is listening for connections. The details about how this connection works and what the connect options will be probably discussed in the next post. A KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED\_RES packet is sent back.

**KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED\_RES (opcode 0x58)**

- **unsigned int 8-bit**: Kad packet identifier
- **unsigned int 8-bit**: KADEMLIA\_FIREWALLED2\_REQ opcode
- **unsigned int 16-bit**: receiver IP address

This message comes back from a firewall request and includes just our IP address. If it is different from the one we already know, it is updated. _A counter is also increased: when it reaches 4, the firewall checks are not needed anymore._ The counter is reset every hour.

These are the first messages sent in a Kad session. The TCP connection that verifies the contacts is a little bit tricky and requires a dedicated post.

I hope it's clear until now, but anyway feel free to comment :)

Catch ya soon...
