<h1>Interest revival.... Hello, again!</h1>

<h2>11-02-2012, 15:22</h2>

<p>This blog is born from an evening made of rage and cries. I've realized that for
so much time I've wasted my time on the PC forgetting to seriously learn what I
was really interested into. I can remember when I was a child, tryin' to
understand how Back Orifice 2000 was really working, how the hell was getting
managed to hide itself from the system and so on... I can remember when I was
trying to understand the asm listing of the Cascade or Michelangelo viruses...</p>

<p>I don't know what happened later, maybe school and university stole so much
time, and I didn't have the time to get better in malware/rootkit
writing/analysis. Now I regret for it... maybe I could have spent now some of
that experience in the job world...</p>

<p>I decided to start learning how rootkits work, how to write them, the
countermeasures, reversing basics and so on... I know I'm something like over 10
years late in doing this, but, even if I won't be able to spend this little
experience in the job world, being something like a small private researcher
will be fine too...</p>

<p>I don't know what I will write in this blog.... maybe my progress in doing this,
which may seem trival to the people that are already in this field, maybe my
thoughts, or maybe this blog won't live so long... who knows...</p>

<p>Hope to write here again...</p>
